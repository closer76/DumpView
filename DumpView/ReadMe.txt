           wxWidgets Wizard : DumpView Project Overview
================================================================================

The application wizard has created this DumpView application for
you. This application not only demonstrates the basics of using the wxWidgets
wizard but is also a starting point for writing your application.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your DumpView application.

DumpView.vcproj
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an application wizard.
    It contains information about the version of the product that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    application wizard.
